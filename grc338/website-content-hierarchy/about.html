                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <h3>An Extraordinary Menu</h3>
                <p>Thirteen years after opening, having moved into the beautiful Half Moon Bay Inn on Main Street Half Moon Bay, our menu has expanded to include seafood and meat selections from our rotisserie and mesquite grill, artful pastas and award winning pizza, creative salads and antipasti, and an array of house desserts. A Tuscan style courtyard patio with fireplaces and a fountain is ideal for large parties and receptions. Our full bar and locally famous bartenders create a lively social ambience nightly. Over one hundred fifty bottles line up on our wine list from Italy, California, France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
                <h3>Emphasis on Locally Grown Foods</h3>
                <p>As always, we have remained faithful to sustainability, supporting local growers and producers, bringing produce and cheeses from local farms, meats and poultry from quality and organic growers, seafood from local waters, and selected wines from local wineries.</p>
                <h3>Community Restaurant Serving Locals</h3>
                <p>Most importantly, we are a community restaurant that serves locals. Lots of locals! However with our new move onto Main Street and into a larger venue, we have become a destination for guests from the greater Bay Area and nationwide. Our advertising is mostly word of mouth. Our energy is inviting, positive and friendly, and when you come in, you are invited to be part of our family.</p>
