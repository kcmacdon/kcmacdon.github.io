                            <p>
                                As expected, right-hander Kevin Gausman and shortstop Brandon Crawford were named All-Stars when Major League Baseball unveiled full rosters on Sunday, joining Buster Posey, who was voted in as the National League’s starting catcher last week. All three will be making the trip to Denver, which will host the 2021 All-Star Game on July 13.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s the first career selection for Gausman, a Centennial, Colo., native who grew up 30 minutes away from Coors Field, and the third for Crawford. Posey, who earned his seventh career All-Star nod, and Crawford will both return to the Midsummer Classic for the first time since 2018 after enjoying resurgent seasons in their age-34 campaigns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Crawford entered Sunday as the club’s offensive MVP after batting .264 with an .885 OPS, 17 home runs and 52 RBIs over 73 games this year. With a week to go until the end of the first half, Crawford is only four home runs shy of matching his career high of 21, which he set over 143 games during his lone Silver Slugger season in 2015.
                            </p>

                                “I can confidently say there’s no one more deserving,” manager Gabe Kapler said following the Giants’ 6-5 comeback win over the D-backs on Saturday. “I know it sounds strange, but he’s made incredible strides this year. I just think the at-bat quality has gotten better than it was even last year, and it was good last year. And then, obviously, he’s been a stabilizing force for us on defense, an incredible presence in the clubhouse as well. Tonight after the game, we all came in and for whatever reason the normal music wasn’t blaring, so Craw got straight to it and played DJ. He does it all right now.”

                                    Buster Posey had the toughest offensive year of his career in 2019. He elected not to play in '20, staying home with his newborn twins during the shortened season held amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And he entered the '21 campaign at age 34, potentially nearing the later stages of his career.

                                <p>
                                    However, Posey appears to still have a lot left in the tank. That’s why he’ll be returning to the All-Star Game for the first time in three years.

                                    On Thursday, Posey was named the starting catcher for the National League in the 2021 All-Star Game presented by Mastercard. It’s the seventh All-Star selection of Posey’s career -- his first since 2018 -- and it’ll be the fifth time he’ll start the Midsummer Classic.

                                    Gausman, 30, has emerged as one of the most dominant pitchers in the Majors this season, going 8-2 with a 1.68 ERA, second only to Mets ace Jacob deGrom (0.95 ERA) among qualified starters. He is lined up to make his final start of the first half against the Nationals on July 11, which will likely make him ineligible to pitch for the NL in the All-Star Game two days later.

                                <p>
                                    “I imagine Gausman is going to want to take the ball for us that day, and we’re going to want him to pitch,” Kapler said. “I always understand how important it is for a pitcher to think about All-Star Game appearances. I think if you ask Kevin right now, he’s pretty focused on his Giants starts.”

                                    The San Francisco Giants have unveiled their City Connect uniforms, becoming the sixth club to reveal a custom jersey as part of the 2021 Nike MLB City Connect Series.

                                    The jersey puts focus on the Giants’ orange color and features a white background in addition to light grey trim on the front and back. San Francisco's gradient “G” logo pays homage to the city’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge, and the historical landmark makes appearances across the jersey’s sleeves as well as the side of the uniform’s orange cap.

                                <p>
                                    The Giants selected Mississippi State right-hander Will Bednar with the 14th overall pick of the 2021 MLB Draft on Sunday night.

                                    Bednar, the first pitcher to be drafted in the first round by the Giants since Phil Bickford in 2015, led Mississippi State to its first College World Series title this year by logging a 1.47 ERA over three starts and delivering six no-hit innings against Vanderbilt in the championship game to capture Most Outstanding Player honors.
