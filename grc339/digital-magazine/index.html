                                    <h3>Gausman, Crawford and Posey chosen as all-stars.</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As expected, right-hander Kevin Gausman and shortstop Brandon Crawford were named All-Stars when Major League Baseball unveiled full rosters on Sunday, joining Buster Posey, who was voted in as the National League’s starting catcher last week. All three will be making the trip to Denver, which will host the 2021 All-Star Game on July 13.

                                        It’s the first career selection for Gausman, a Centennial, Colo., native who grew up 30 minutes away from Coors Field, and the third for Crawford. Posey, who earned his seventh career All-Star nod, and Crawford will both return to the Midsummer Classic for the first time since 2018 after enjoying resurgent seasons in their age-34 campaigns.Check out our main story page for more information on the story.

                                <p>
                                    With a starting rotation that has posted the third-best ERA in baseball (3.18), a bullpen that has stabilized with the arrival of Leone (0.98 ERA) and others, and a defense that ranks second in the Majors with 24 outs above average, there’s not much the Giants are doing poorly right now, which bodes well for their ability to sustain their playoff push in the second half. They are poised to get even stronger with improved health, as Posey, Brandon Belt, Evan Longoria and Tommy La Stella could be ready to rejoin the club by the end of July.

                                <p>
                                    The Giants selected Mississippi State right-hander Will Bednar with the 14th overall pick of the 2021 MLB Draft on Sunday night.

                                    Bednar, the first pitcher to be drafted in the first round by the Giants since Phil Bickford in 2015, led Mississippi State to its first College World Series title this year by logging a 1.47 ERA over three starts and delivering six no-hit innings against Vanderbilt in the championship game to capture Most Outstanding Player honors.

                                    Gausman struck out nine and yielded only one run over six-plus innings as the Giants capped their spectacular first half with a 3-1 victory that sealed a three-game sweep of the Nationals. At 57-32, San Francisco will head into the All-Star break with the best record in baseball for the seventh time in franchise history and the first time since 2016.
